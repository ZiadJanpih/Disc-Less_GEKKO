# Disc-Less_GEKKO
Disc-Less (Discrimination Less) is a python prototype for discrimination-aware data transformation in the pre-processing pipelines. in which the data transformations are rewriten to statisfy some non-discrimination constraints ( mainly we consider Coverage and fairness ).The problem has been modeled as aconstraints optimization problem of type MINLP (Mixed Integer Non-Linear Programming), a non-linear solver is needed to find the solution.
