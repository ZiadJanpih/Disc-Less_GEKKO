# Disc-Less_GEKKO
Disc-Less (Discrimination Less) is a Python prototype designed for discrimination-aware data transformation within pre-processing pipelines. This tool focuses on rewriting data transformations to adhere to specific non-discrimination constraints, with a primary emphasis on coverage and fairness. The underlying problem is formulated as a constrained optimization problem of the MINLP (Mixed Integer Non-Linear Programming) type, and a non-linear solver is employed to discover the optimal solution.
